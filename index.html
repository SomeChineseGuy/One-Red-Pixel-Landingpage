        <h2>MORE THAN JUST BEING CREATIVE</h2>
        <p>Every creative journey starts with an idea. That idea then creates a vision. That vision then puts us down a creative path that leads to a finished product. At One Red Pixel we believe ideas are sacred, and we understand that bringing an idea to life can be a difficult process. That’s why we want to use our industry knowledge, skills, and experience to help do your idea justice and bring it into the world in a way you can be proud of. We facilitate your idea from the idea stage to execution stage through a collaborative process with our clients. The good part for you is that we are a small, hands on operation so you don’t have to run through the gauntlet of a bunch of middle men. Instead of play broken telephone with your idea as you go through constant emailed revisions, revisions, and more revisions like you would when dealing with a larger studio. At One Red Pixel we give your idea the attention it deserves and work with you through every step of the process, our mantra is to work together with the client to create a shared creative experience.
            We believe the creative experience is a journey, a journey we can take together.</p>
